# Pac-Man collectibles service
Small service that allows to define a set of collectible positions (`Position(x, y)`) and then collect individual positions.

This service is used by [pacman-kubernetes-linkerd](https://github.com/miciek/pacman-kubernetes-linkerd) project, which contains all necessary steps to follow live coding part of my talk [Tearing down the pyramid... using functions and meshes](https://speakerdeck.com/miciek/tear-down-this-pyramid-dot-dot-dot-using-functions-and-meshes).
